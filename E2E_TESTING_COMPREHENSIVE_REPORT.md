---

## ‚úÖ TEST 1: AUTHENTICATION FLOW - **PASSED**

### Test Execution
1. ‚úÖ Navigated to `http://localhost:3000`
2. ‚úÖ Located and clicked "Login" button in navigation
3. ‚úÖ Login page loaded at `/login`
4. ‚úÖ Login form appeared with email and password fields
5. ‚úÖ Entered test credentials:
   - Email: `user1@iwm.com`
   - Password: `rmrnn0077`
6. ‚úÖ Clicked "Login" button
7. ‚úÖ Form submitted successfully
8. ‚úÖ Redirected to `/profile/user1`
9. ‚úÖ User profile button appeared in navigation with "Test User" avatar
10. ‚úÖ JWT token stored in localStorage

### Success Criteria Met
- [x] Login button exists and is clickable
- [x] Login form appears with username and password fields
- [x] Form submission succeeds without errors
- [x] User is redirected after login
- [x] User profile/avatar appears in navigation header
- [x] JWT token is stored in browser storage (`access_token` in localStorage)
- [x] No critical console errors during login flow

### Token Verification
```javascript
{
  hasToken: true,
  tokenPreview: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxI...",
  user: null
}
```

### üêõ BUG DISCOVERED

**BUG #1: Profile Page Shows "User not found"**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `/profile/user1`
- **Description:** After successful login, user is redirected to `/profile/user1` which shows "User not found" error page
- **Root Cause:** Backend endpoint `/api/v1/users/profile/user1` returns 404
- **Console Error:** `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) @ http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/profile/user1`
- **Impact:** User cannot view their profile page after login
- **Recommended Fix:**
  1. Create backend endpoint: `GET /api/v1/users/profile/{username}` or `GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}`
  2. Or redirect to homepage instead of profile page after login
  3. Update login redirect logic in frontend

### Console Errors (Non-Critical)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Failed to fetch user: Error: Invalid token` - Occurs before login, expected behavior
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Failed to load resource: favicon.ico` - Missing favicon, cosmetic issue
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple Next.js Image warnings about legacy props - Framework upgrade needed
