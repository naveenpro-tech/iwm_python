### New Columns in Movies Table

| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Index | Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| `curation_status` | String(20) | Yes | "draft" | ✅ | Track curation status |
| `quality_score` | Integer | Yes | NULL | ✅ | Quality rating (0-100) |
| `curator_notes` | Text | Yes | NULL | ❌ | Curator comments |
| `curated_by_id` | Integer (FK) | Yes | NULL | ✅ | Who curated it |

### Indexes Created

1. **ix_movies_curation_status** - For filtering by status
2. **ix_movies_quality_score** - For filtering by quality
3. **ix_movies_curated_by_id** - For finding curator's movies
4. **ix_movies_curated_at** - For sorting by curation date

### Foreign Key Constraint
