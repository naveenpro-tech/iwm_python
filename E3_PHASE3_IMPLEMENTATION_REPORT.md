## Backend Verification

✅ **All required endpoints already exist in `apps/backend/src/routers/roles.py`:**

- `GET /api/v1/roles/{role_type}` (lines 340-396)
  - Returns role-specific profile data
  - Requires authentication
  - Supports critic, talent, industry role types

- `PUT /api/v1/roles/{role_type}/profile` (lines 403-468)
  - Updates role-specific profile fields
  - Requires authentication
  - Validates input data with Pydantic models
  - Returns updated profile data

- Database models verified:
  - `CriticProfile` (lines 1086-1119 in models.py)
  - `TalentProfile` (lines 228-253 in models.py)
  - `IndustryProfile` (lines 256-280 in models.py)

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Centralized Routing Utility**
   - Single source of truth for profile routes
   - Easy to maintain and update
   - Reusable across components

2. **Conditional Tab Rendering**
   - Only show tabs for roles user has access to
   - Reduces UI clutter
   - Improves user experience

3. **Separate Settings Components**
   - Each role has dedicated component
   - Easier to maintain and test
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **API Client Functions**
   - Centralized API calls
   - Consistent error handling
   - Easy to mock for testing

---

## Next Steps (Epic E-3 Phase 4)

1. **Industry Profile Route Enhancement**
   - Replace `/people` placeholder with `/industry/profile/me`
   - Create dedicated industry profile page

2. **Profile Visibility Settings**
   - Add privacy controls for each role profile
   - Allow users to hide/show specific roles

3. **Role Profile Completion Indicators**
   - Show progress bars for profile completion
   - Suggest missing fields

4. **Profile Preview**
   - Add preview of how profile looks to others
   - Show public vs. private fields

---

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required (backend models already exist)
- No environment variable changes needed
- All new components are client-side only
- API endpoints already implemented and tested
- Ready for immediate deployment

---

## Known Limitations

1. Industry profile routing currently uses `/people` as placeholder
   - Will be updated to `/industry/profile/me` in Phase 4

2. Role profile creation is automatic on signup
   - Users cannot manually create new role profiles
   - All roles are created with default values
