# Phase 2: Quick Reference Guide

## 🎯 What Was Done

Phase 2 added curation fields to the Movie model with complete database migration, validation schemas, and comprehensive tests.

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `apps/backend/alembic/versions/a1b2c3d4e5f7_add_curation_fields_to_movies.py`

```python
# Adds 6 columns to movies table:
- curation_status (String, default: "draft")
- quality_score (Integer, 0-100)
- curator_notes (Text)
- curated_by_id (Foreign Key to users)
- curated_at (DateTime)
- last_reviewed_at (DateTime)

# Creates 4 indexes for performance
# Includes upgrade() and downgrade() functions
```

### 2. Pydantic Schemas
**File:** `apps/backend/src/schemas/curation.py`

```python
# 7 Schemas:
- CurationBase (base with validation)
- CurationCreate (for creating)
- CurationUpdate (for partial updates)
- CuratorInfo (curator details)
- CurationResponse (with curator info)
- MovieCurationResponse (movie + curation)
- CurationBulkUpdate (bulk operations)
```

### 3. Unit Tests
**File:** `apps/backend/tests/test_curation_schema.py`

```python
# 19 comprehensive tests:
- Schema validation tests
- Boundary condition tests
- Error handling tests
- Enum validation tests
- All tests PASSING ✅
```

## 📊 Files Modified

### Movie Model
**File:** `apps/backend/src/models.py`

```python
# Added:
class CurationStatus(str, PyEnum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    PENDING_REVIEW = "pending_review"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    REJECTED = "rejected"

# Added to Movie class:
curation_status: Mapped[str | None]
quality_score: Mapped[int | None]
curator_notes: Mapped[str | None]
curated_by_id: Mapped[int | None]
curated_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
last_reviewed_at: Mapped[datetime | None]
curated_by: Mapped["User | None"]
```

---

## 🧪 Test Results

```
✅ test_curation_schema.py: 19/19 PASSED
✅ test_admin_rbac.py: 4/4 PASSED (regression)
✅ Total: 23/23 PASSED (100%)
```

---

## 🚀 How to Apply Migration

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd apps/backend

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head

# Check current revision
alembic current

# Rollback if needed
alembic downgrade -1
```

## 📝 Curation Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Initial status, not reviewed |
| `pending_review` | Waiting for review |
| `approved` | Approved for publication |
| `rejected` | Rejected, needs revision |

---

## 🎯 Quality Score Range

| Range | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 0-20 | Poor |
| 21-40 | Below Average |
| 41-60 | Average |
| 61-80 | Good |
| 81-100 | Excellent |

## 📚 Schema Usage Examples

### Create Curation
```python
from src.schemas.curation import CurationCreate

curation = CurationCreate(
    curation_status="pending_review",
    quality_score=75,
    curator_notes="Needs review"
)
```

### Update Curation
```python
from src.schemas.curation import CurationUpdate

update = CurationUpdate(
    quality_score=85,
    curation_status="approved"
)
```

### Bulk Update
```python
from src.schemas.curation import CurationBulkUpdate

bulk = CurationBulkUpdate(
    movie_ids=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    curation_status="approved",
    quality_score=80
)
```

---

## 🔒 Database Constraints

### Foreign Key
- `fk_movies_curated_by_id` → users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

### Indexes
1. `ix_movies_curation_status` - Filter by status
2. `ix_movies_quality_score` - Filter by quality
3. `ix_movies_curated_by_id` - Find curator's movies
4. `ix_movies_curated_at` - Sort by curation date

---

## ✅ Validation Rules

### Quality Score
- Must be between 0 and 100
- Raises ValidationError if outside range

### Curation Status
- Must be one of: draft, pending_review, approved, rejected
- Raises ValidationError if invalid

### Curator Notes
- Optional text field
- No length restrictions
