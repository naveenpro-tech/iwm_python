## BUG #1: Default/Demo Data Appearing for New Users in Profile Favorites

### Issue Description
When a new user signed up, they were seeing default/demo data (lists or items) appearing under their Favorites tab in the profile page, even though they hadn't added anything yet.

### Root Cause
The backend endpoint `GET /api/v1/favorites` was:
1. **Not protected** - didn't require authentication
2. **Not filtering by user** - returned ALL favorites from ALL users when no `userId` parameter was passed
3. **Frontend not passing user ID** - the frontend was calling the endpoint without any user filter

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Fix: `apps/backend/src/routers/favorites.py`

**Changed from:**
```python
@router.get("")
async def list_favorites(
    page: int = 1,
    limit: int = 20,
    userId: str | None = None,  # Optional parameter
    type: str | None = None,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session),  # No auth required
) -> Any:
    repo = FavoriteRepository(session)
    return await repo.list(page=page, limit=limit, user_id=userId, type_filter=type)
```

**Changed to:**
```python
@router.get("")
async def list_favorites(
    page: int = 1,
    limit: int = 20,
    type: str | None = None,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),  # Required auth
) -> Any:
    repo = FavoriteRepository(session)
    # Always filter by current user for security
    return await repo.list(page=page, limit=limit, user_id=current_user.external_id, type_filter=type)
```

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… Added `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)` - requires authentication
- âœ… Removed optional `userId` parameter - always uses current user
- âœ… Passes `current_user.external_id` to repository - filters by authenticated user

### Verification Results

```
âœ… Existing user (user1) has their own favorites: 2 items
âœ… New user has NO default favorites: 0 items
âœ… BUG #1 IS FIXED!
```

## BUG #2: Collection Share Link Showing Profile URL Instead of Collection URL

### Issue Description
When sharing a collection, the share link was pointing to the user's profile page instead of the specific collection's public page.

### Root Cause
1. **No public collection view** - there was no `/collections/{id}/public` page for unauthenticated access
2. **Protected route** - `/collections` route was protected and required authentication
3. **Share URL was current page** - the share function copied `window.location.href` which was the protected collection detail page

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Public Collection View Page: `app/collections/[id]/public/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- âœ… Displays collection details without authentication
- âœ… Shows all movies in the collection
- âœ… Checks if collection is public before displaying
- âœ… Returns error if collection is private
- âœ… Supports grid and list view modes
- âœ… Responsive design matching the app theme

#### 2. Updated Middleware: `middleware.ts`

**Added public route exception:**
```typescript
// Routes that are public (don't require authentication)
const publicRoutes = [
  /^\/collections\/[^/]+\/public$/,  // Public collection view: /collections/{id}/public
]

// Check if the route is public
const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.some((route) => route.test(pathname))
if (isPublicRoute) {
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… Added regex pattern to match `/collections/{id}/public` routes
- âœ… Public routes bypass authentication check
- âœ… Allows unauthenticated users to view shared collections

#### 3. Updated Collection Detail Component: `components/collections/collection-detail.tsx`

**Changed share URL generation:**
```typescript
const handleShare = async () => {
  try {
    // Generate public share URL
    const baseUrl = typeof window !== "undefined" ? window.location.origin : ""
    const shareUrl = `${baseUrl}/collections/${id}/public`
    
    if (navigator.share) {
      await navigator.share({ title: collection?.title || "Collection", url: shareUrl })
    } else {
      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(shareUrl)
      toast({ title: "Link copied!", description: "Collection link copied to clipboard" })
    }
  } catch (err) {
    // Fallback to clipboard on error
    ...
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… Generates public URL: `/collections/{id}/public`
- âœ… Uses full URL with origin for sharing
- âœ… Works with both native share API and clipboard fallback

### Verification Results

```
âœ… Found collection: tygfbxc (ID: de2c931e-8699-4b81-a0f5-fb38624537f5)
âœ… Expected share URL: http://localhost:3000/collections/de2c931e-8699-4b81-a0f5-fb38624537f5/public
âœ… Public collection page is accessible (status 200)
âœ… BUG #2 IS FIXED!
```

## Testing Summary

### Test 1: New User Favorites (BUG #1)
- âœ… Created new user: `testuser94820@iwm.com`
- âœ… Verified NO default favorites (0 items)
- âœ… Existing user still has their favorites (2 items)

### Test 2: Collection Share URL (BUG #2)

## Security Considerations

âœ… **BUG #1 Fix:**
- Favorites endpoint now requires authentication
- Users can only see their own favorites
- No data leakage between users

âœ… **BUG #2 Fix:**
- Public collection pages only accessible if collection is marked public
- Private collections return error message
- Unauthenticated users cannot access private collections
