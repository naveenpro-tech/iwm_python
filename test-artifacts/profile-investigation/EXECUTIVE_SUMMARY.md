## BUG #1: Default/Demo Data in New User Favorites

### Issue
New users were seeing favorites from OTHER users in their profile.

### Root Cause
Backend endpoint `GET /api/v1/favorites` was:
- Not protected (no authentication)
- Not filtering by user
- Returning ALL favorites from ALL users

### Fix
Modified `apps/backend/src/routers/favorites.py`:
- Added authentication requirement
- Changed to always filter by current user
- Removed optional userId parameter

### Verification
```
‚úÖ New user has 0 favorites (correct)
‚úÖ Existing user has their own favorites (correct)
‚úÖ No data leakage between users (correct)
```

## BUG #2: Collection Share Link Issues

### Issue
Collection share links didn't work for unauthenticated users.

### Root Cause
- No public collection view page
- `/collections` route was protected
- Share URL pointed to protected route
- Unauthenticated users redirected to login

### Fix
1. Created public collection view: `app/collections/[id]/public/page.tsx`
2. Updated middleware to allow public access
3. Updated share URL generation to use `/collections/{id}/public`

### Verification
```
‚úÖ Public collection page loads without auth (status 200)
‚úÖ No redirect to login
‚úÖ Collection content displayed
‚úÖ Share links work in incognito mode
```

---

- `apps/backend/src/routers/favorites.py` - Added authentication

### Frontend (3 files)
