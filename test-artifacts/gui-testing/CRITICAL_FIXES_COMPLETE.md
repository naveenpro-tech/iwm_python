## 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**

### **BUG: Watchlist "Failed to fetch" Error** ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Users couldn't add movies to watchlist  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

**Problem:**
```
TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at addToWatchlist (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./lib/api/watchlist.ts:20:32)
```

**Root Cause:**
Backend endpoint `POST /api/v1/watchlist` was trying to access `body.rating` and `body.priority` fields that didn't exist in the `WatchlistItemIn` Pydantic model, causing a 500 Internal Server Error.

**Error from Backend Logs:**
```python
AttributeError: 'WatchlistItemIn' object has no attribute 'rating'
```

**Solution:**
1. Added `rating` and `priority` fields to `WatchlistItemIn` model
2. Updated repository to accept these optional parameters
3. Restarted backend server

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/backend/src/routers/watchlist.py` (lines 14-20, 58-71)
- `apps/backend/src/repositories/watchlist.py` (line 82)

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
class WatchlistItemIn(BaseModel):
    movieId: str
    userId: str
    status: str = "want-to-watch"
    progress: Optional[int] = None

# After (FIXED):
class WatchlistItemIn(BaseModel):
    movieId: str
    userId: str
    status: str = "want-to-watch"
    progress: Optional[int] = None
    rating: Optional[int] = None  # Added
    priority: Optional[str] = None  # Added
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Backend API test: Status 200 (was 500)
- ✅ GUI test: Button changes to "Remove from Watchlist"
- ✅ No more "Failed to fetch" errors

**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Share button exists but modal doesn't open  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
