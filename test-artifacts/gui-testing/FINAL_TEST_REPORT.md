## üîß FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Issue #1: Environment Variables Not Loading in Browser
**Problem:** Frontend environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BACKEND` were not being loaded in the browser, causing login to fail with "Backend not enabled" error.

**Root Cause:** `lib/auth.ts` was using static module-level constants that evaluated at load time, before Next.js could replace them with actual values.

**Solution:** Modified `lib/auth.ts` to use dynamic getter functions:
- Created `getApiBase()` function that checks `window.__ENV__` first, then falls back to `process.env`
- Created `getUseBackend()` function that does the same
- Updated `request()` function to call these getters at runtime instead of using static constants

**File Modified:** `lib/auth.ts`

---

### Issue #2: Login Form Not Submitting
**Problem:** Clicking the login button was not triggering form submission.

**Solution:** Updated test to press Enter in the password field instead of clicking the button, which properly triggers form submission.

**File Modified:** `scripts/fresh_account_gui_test_v2.py`

---

### Issue #3: Modal Dialog Blocking Form Submission
**Problem:** When creating a collection, a modal dialog was intercepting pointer events and blocking clicks on form elements.

**Solution:** Updated test to use `force=True` parameter in click() calls to bypass overlay elements.

**File Modified:** `scripts/fresh_account_gui_test_v2.py`

---
