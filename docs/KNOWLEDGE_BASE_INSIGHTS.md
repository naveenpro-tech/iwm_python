## ‚ö° PostgreSQL Performance Secrets

### Secret 1: Prepared Statements
**What:** Pre-compile queries and reuse with different parameters  
**Performance Gain:** Significant reduction in parse/plan time  
**How It Works:**
```sql
PREPARE get_movie (text) AS 
  SELECT * FROM movies WHERE external_id = $1;
EXECUTE get_movie('inception');
```
**Action:** SQLAlchemy already uses prepared statements - verify it's enabled

### Secret 2: Strategic Indexing
**What:** Create indexes on frequently queried columns  
**Performance Gain:** Orders of magnitude faster for large tables  
**Critical Indexes for IWM:**
- `movies.title` (trigram for fuzzy search)
- `reviews.movie_id, reviews.date` (composite)
- `users.email` (unique)
- `pulses.created_at` (DESC for feed)
- `notifications.user_id, notifications.is_read` (composite)
**Action:** Already created 100+ indexes - verify they're being used

### Secret 3: Table Partitioning
**What:** Split large tables into smaller logical chunks  
**Performance Gain:** Faster queries on partitioned data  
**Tables to Partition in IWM:**
- `reviews` - by year (500K+ rows expected)
- `notifications` - by month (5M+ rows expected)
- `pulses` - by month (1M+ rows expected)
- `admin_metric_snapshots` - by month
**Action:** Implement partitioning using pg_partman extension

### Secret 4: COPY Command for Bulk Inserts
**What:** Bulk insert from CSV/file instead of individual INSERTs  
**Performance Gain:** Orders of magnitude faster  
**Use Cases for IWM:**
- Initial movie data import
- Bulk user imports
- Data migrations
**Action:** Use COPY for any bulk data operations

### Secret 5: Read Replicas
**What:** Separate read and write databases  
**Performance Gain:** Horizontal scaling for read-heavy workloads  
**When to Use:** When single database can't handle read load  
**Action:** Plan for future - not needed initially

## üöÄ FastAPI Best Practices (Production-Ready)

### Practice 1: NEVER Use async def for Blocking Operations ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Rule:** If it blocks (time.sleep, requests, file I/O), use `def` not `async def`  
**Why:** Blocks the entire event loop  
**Examples of Blocking:**
- `time.sleep()` ‚Üí Use `asyncio.sleep()`
- `requests.get()` ‚Üí Use `httpx.AsyncClient()`
- `open()` for files ‚Üí Use `aiofiles`
- Synchronous DB clients ‚Üí Use async clients (AsyncPG ‚úÖ)
**Action:** Audit all endpoints - ensure blocking operations use `def`

### Practice 2: Use Async-Friendly Libraries
**Required Changes:**
- ‚úÖ `asyncpg` instead of `psycopg2`
- ‚úÖ `httpx.AsyncClient` instead of `requests`
- ‚úÖ `aiofiles` for file operations
- ‚úÖ `motor` for MongoDB (if used)
**Already Implemented:** ‚úÖ Using AsyncPG and httpx
**Action:** Verify no blocking libraries are used

### Practice 3: Don't Do Heavy Computation in Endpoints
**Rule:** FastAPI is for I/O-bound workloads, not CPU-bound  
**Heavy Operations:**
- Image/video processing
- ML model inference
- Large data transformations
**Solutions:**
- Lightweight ML (<100ms): OK in endpoint
- Heavy ML: Use dedicated inference server (Triton, TorchServe)
- Long-running: Use queue + worker (Celery, RQ)
**Use Cases for IWM:**
- Movie poster processing ‚Üí Background task or worker
- Gemini AI enrichment ‚Üí Already async, but consider queue for bulk
**Action:** Move heavy operations to background tasks or workers

### Practice 4: Dependencies Follow Same Rules
**Rule:** Dependencies use `def` for blocking, `async def` for non-blocking  
**Action:** Audit all dependencies in `src/dependencies/`

### Practice 5: Use BackgroundTasks for Fire-and-Forget
**What:** FastAPI's built-in background task system  
**Use Cases for IWM:**
- Send email notifications
- Log events
- Update cache
**Limitations:**
- Not for guaranteed delivery
- Not for long-running tasks
- Lost if process crashes
**When to Use Queue Instead:**
- Needs retries
- Needs guaranteed delivery
- Long-running (>30 seconds)
**Action:** Use BackgroundTasks for simple tasks, queue for critical ones

### Practice 6: Hide Swagger/ReDoc in Production
**Rule:** Set `docs_url=None`, `redoc_url=None`, `openapi_url=None` in production  
**Why:** Security - don't expose incomplete/insecure endpoints  
**Action:** Add environment-based configuration

### Practice 7: Use Custom Base Model
**What:** Create a base Pydantic model for global config  
**Benefits:**
- Centralized configuration
- Alias generators (camelCase ‚Üî snake_case)
- Custom JSON encoders (datetime, Decimal, ObjectId)
**Action:** Create `BaseModel` with global settings

### Practice 8: Don't Manually Construct Response Models
**Rule:** Return dict/list, let FastAPI handle validation  
**Why:** FastAPI does it anyway - no performance benefit  
**Action:** Return plain dicts from endpoints

### Practice 9: Validate with Pydantic, Not Code
**Rule:** Push validation into Pydantic models, not endpoint logic  
**Benefits:**
- Consistent error responses
- Auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- Reusable validation
**Action:** Move all validation to Pydantic models

### Practice 10: Use Dependencies for DB Validation
**What:** Create dependencies for database-based validation  
**Benefits:**
- Reusable across endpoints
- Cached per request (no performance hit)
- Clean endpoint code
**Use Cases for IWM:**
- Verify user owns review before editing
- Check movie exists before adding to collection
- Validate admin permissions
**Action:** Create validation dependencies

### Practice 11: Use Connection Pool, Not Per-Request Connections
**Rule:** Create pool in lifespan, inject via dependency  
**Two Approaches:**
1. Store in `app.state` (recommended)
2. Global variable (legacy)
**Already Implemented:** ‚úÖ Using lifespan with connection pool
**Action:** Verify pool is properly configured

### Practice 12: Use Lifespan for App Resources
**Rule:** Use `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan instead of `@app.on_event`  
**Benefits:**
- Unified setup/cleanup
- Guaranteed cleanup even if startup fails
- Better error handling
**Already Implemented:** ‚úÖ Using lifespan in `main.py`
**Action:** Verify all resources are properly managed

### Practice 13: Never Hardcode Secrets
**Rule:** Use `.env` file + Pydantic `BaseSettings`  
**What to Store:**
- Database URLs
- API keys
- JWT secrets
- Port numbers
**What NOT to Store:**
- Business logic
- Complex behavior
**Already Implemented:** ‚úÖ Using Pydantic Settings
**Action:** Verify no secrets in code, add `.env.example`

### Practice 14: Use Structured Logging
**Rule:** Use `logging`, `loguru`, or `structlog` - NOT `print()`  
**Benefits:**
- Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
- Contextual information (request_id, user_id)
- Centralized logging (Elasticsearch)
**Already Implemented:** ‚úÖ Using structlog
**Action:** Add request_id middleware, configure log levels

### Practice 15: Production Deployment
**Requirements:**
- Run Uvicorn with Gunicorn + UvicornWorker
- Install `uvloop` for performance boost
- Tune workers: `(CPU cores * 2) + 1`
- Containerize with Docker
**Action:** Create production deployment configuration
