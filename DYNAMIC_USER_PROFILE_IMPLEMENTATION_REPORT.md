1. ✅ **Dynamic User Profile Route** - `/profile/[username]/page.tsx`
2. ✅ **Profile Redirect Handler** - `/profile/page.tsx` (redirects to dynamic route)
3. ✅ **Login Redirect Update** - Redirects to `/profile/[username]` after authentication
4. ✅ **User Type Enhancement** - Added `username` field to User type
5. ✅ **Component Updates** - Updated ProfileHeader, ProfileOverview, ProfileSettings to work with dynamic routing

## 🎯 URL STRUCTURE CHANGES

### **Before (WRONG):**
```
http://localhost:3000/profile  ← Static, same for all users
```

### **After (CORRECT):**
```
http://localhost:3000/profile/siddu-kumar  ← Dynamic, unique per user
http://localhost:3000/profile/john-doe     ← Different user
http://localhost:3000/profile/user123      ← Alternative: use user ID
```

### **Backward Compatibility:**
```
http://localhost:3000/profile  → Redirects to /profile/[username] (if authenticated)
                                → Redirects to /login (if not authenticated)
```

---

## 🔄 AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### **Login Flow (Updated):**
```
1. User enters email and password
2. Login API call succeeds
3. Fetch user data (/auth/me)
4. Extract username from user data
   - Use user.username if available
   - Otherwise, extract from email (before @)
   - Sanitize: lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens
5. Redirect to /profile/[username]
6. Profile page loads user-specific data
```

### **Profile Access Flow:**
```
1. User navigates to /profile
2. Check authentication status
3. If authenticated:
   - Fetch user data
   - Extract username
   - Redirect to /profile/[username]
4. If not authenticated:
   - Redirect to /login
```

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/profile
   → Redirects to http://localhost:3000/profile/[your-username]
   ```

3. **Access specific user profile:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/profile/siddu-kumar
   http://localhost:3000/profile/john-doe
   http://localhost:3000/profile/user123

4. **Test login redirect:**
   ```
   1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   2. Enter credentials
   3. Click "Login"
   4. Should redirect to http://localhost:3000/profile/[username]
   ```
