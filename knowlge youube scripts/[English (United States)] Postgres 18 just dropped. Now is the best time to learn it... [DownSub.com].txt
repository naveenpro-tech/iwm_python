The Postgres 18 official release 
is just around the corner,  
and we really need to talk about it. Granted, 
database updates might feel niche or boring,  
but this time around the changes 
are too big to ignore. After all,  
Postgres is one of the few pieces of software that 
quietly powers almost everything, from your side  
project running on a $5 VPS to massive systems 
handling billions of records in production.
Probably the most important addition of this 
release is the new support for asynchronous  
input and output, which fundamentally changes how 
Postgres deals with disk operations. For years,  
Postgres handled I/O the old-fashioned 
way, blocking on every read and write,  
and waiting patiently for the disk 
to respond before moving on. Granted,  
this is reliable, but it is also painfully 
slow under load in read-heavy applications.
Version 18 changes this architecture. The 
database can now queue up multiple operations  
at once and process them as the results come 
in. That means faster queries, lower latency,  
and performance improvements up to two or 
three times better in real-world tests.
But the performance improvements don’t stop 
here. PostgreSQL 18 brings a bunch of smart,  
under-the-hood optimizations that make 
your queries run faster without having  
to rewrite anything. First, we get 
smarter handling of OR and IN clauses,  
with Postgres now automatically 
rewriting them into ANY expressions,  
which the planner can optimize more 
efficiently. Second, hash joins got  
a serious upgrade. In previous versions, 
they were already useful for large datasets,  
but now they’re faster and more memory-efficient, 
especially when joining large tables.
On the developer experience 
front, Postgres 18 actually  
delivers features that make schema design 
and application development less painful.
One of the most noticeable changes is 
that virtual generated columns are now  
the default. Instead of storing 
computed values in the table,  
Postgres calculates them on the fly when 
you read the data. That means less storage,  
faster insert and update operations, and fewer 
headaches when dealing with derived values.
Another interesting addition is the built-in 
support for UUID version 7. Unlike the randomness  
of UUID version 4, UUIDv7 includes a timestamp 
component, which makes them naturally ordered  
and much friendlier to B-tree indexes. And of 
course you can extract the timestamp directly  
from the UUID itself, which is a nice 
bonus for debugging or sorting records.
The RETURNING clause got smarter 
as well. You can now access both  
the old and new values of a row in a single 
statement. This makes things like auditing,  
logging, or even undo operations far simpler.
However, one of Postgres's many strengths 
is its reliability and support for enforcing  
validations at the database level, and version 18 
continues to push that forward. One particularly  
useful new feature is the support for temporal 
constraints using the WITHOUT OVERLAPS clause.  
This lets you define time ranges in your schema 
and ensure they don’t overlap. So if you’re  
building something like room bookings, 
scheduling systems, or rental platforms,  
you no longer need to rely on complex app logic 
or awkward triggers to prevent double-bookings.  
The database will enforce it for 
you, and it will do it efficiently.
Finally, another underrated but very impactful 
change is how Postgres 18 handles upgrades.  
Historically, after a major version upgrade, you'd 
have to re-run ANALYZE across your entire database  
to rebuild planner statistics. That step could 
take hours on large datasets and would leave  
performance unpredictable until it finished. 
Now, statistics are preserved during upgrades,  
so version upgrades are much smoother and less 
risky, especially in production environments.
