Modern webdev is kind of broken. We have
tools for everything. Yet somehow it's
never been harder to build something
simple. You want to deploy an app.
Suddenly you're juggling 15 services. O
cache, cron jobs, monitoring, vector
search, full text search, graphql, APIs.
Your to-do list app now needs a seed
round. But here's a wild thought. What
if you just use Postgres? That's right.
The boring old SQL database you ignored
in boot camp. It's secretly a full stack
platform in disguise. Let me explain. N
flexibility like no SQL. Postgres has
JSON B. You can store dynamic
unstructured data and still query it
with SQL. No need to ditch schemas. You
get structure and chaos. Best of both
worlds. Need a cron job? Install the
pgron extension. Schedule SQL queries to
run every hour, every day, whenever. No
extra server. No janky Linux scripts,
just SQL magic caching. Use unlog
tables. They skip disc rights, live in
memory, and are perfect for fastchanging
throwaway data. Still think you need
Reddus, Firebase, Alolia. Let's go
deeper. Want vector search for AI stuff?
PG Vector gives you real vector data
types. You can store embeddings, find
nearest neighbors, and do rag style
lookups all inside your database. Need
full text search with fuzzy matching?
Postgres has TS vector rank search
results. Handle typos. Build your own
search engine without elastic. Need
graphql? PgraphphQL turns your tables
into a GraphQL API. Writes SQL get
structured queries. No back-end server
required. Want realtime data sync like
Firebase? ElectricSQL wraps around
Postgress and keeps the front end fresh.
No polling, no websocket pain, just data
that stays up to date. Okay, but what
about O? You can hash passwords with PG
crypto, sign JWTs with PGJWT, and write
rowle security policies to make sure
users only see their own data, all
within SQL. Now, analytics. Tired of
Google Analytics or shipping data to a
paid SAS. Just use PGMET. It turns
Postgres into a time series database
with duct DB style column storage. Great
for metrics, dashboards, and tracking
what users do. And if you're wondering
how to host all this platforms like Neon
could use serverless Postgres with
branching, scaling, and sane pricing. At
this point, uh, you've got a cache, a
job scheduler, a vector store, a search
engine, a GraphQL server, real-time
sync, O and analytics, all built on a
database. No JavaScript framework drama,
no surprise invoices, no tendencies just
to send a welcome email. So yeah,
Postgres isn't just SQL anymore. It's
the Swiss Army knife of modern webdev.
And next time someone says, "Let's spin
up six microservices and four SAS tools
for this MVP," just smile and say, "Hey,
why don't we try Postgress first?
