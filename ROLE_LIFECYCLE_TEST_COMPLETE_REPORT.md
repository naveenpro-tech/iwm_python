### Status
‚è≥ **PENDING** - To be completed after Phase 3

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug #1: "Failed to fetch user roles" Error on Login Page ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** When navigating to `/login`, the console showed an error because `useRoles` hook was making API calls before the user was authenticated.

**Root Cause:** The `RoleProvider` wraps the entire app (including unauthenticated pages), and `useRoles` was making API calls without checking for authentication.

**Fix Applied:** Modified `hooks/useRoles.ts` to check for `access_token` in localStorage before making API calls. If no token exists, skip the API call and set empty state.

**Verification:** ‚úÖ Login page now loads without errors
