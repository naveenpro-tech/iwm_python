## 🏗️ Admin System Architecture

### **Backend Protection**
```
User Request → Admin Layout Check
    ↓
Call /api/v1/admin/analytics/overview
    ↓
Backend: require_admin dependency
    ↓
Check: role_profiles contains admin role
    ↓
✅ Authorized → Render Dashboard
❌ Unauthorized → Redirect to /dashboard
```

### **Frontend Protection**
```
User navigates to /admin
    ↓
Admin Layout useEffect
    ↓
Fetch /api/v1/admin/analytics/overview
    ↓
✅ 200 OK → setIsAuthorized(true)
❌ 403 Forbidden → Redirect to /dashboard
❌ 401 Unauthorized → Redirect to /login
```
