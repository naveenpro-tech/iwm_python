2. `components/navigation/profile-dropdown.tsx` - Added role-based routing

---

## Backend Verification

✅ All required endpoints already exist and are fully functional:
- `GET /api/v1/roles/{role_type}` - Returns role profile data
- `PUT /api/v1/roles/{role_type}/profile` - Updates role profile
- Database models verified: CriticProfile, TalentProfile, IndustryProfile

---

## Testing Coverage

### Backend Tests (12 cases)
- ✅ GET critic profile
- ✅ GET talent profile
- ✅ GET industry profile
- ✅ PUT critic profile
- ✅ PUT talent profile
- ✅ PUT industry profile
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Nonexistent profile handling

### Frontend E2E Tests (18+ cases)
- ✅ Tab visibility for each role
- ✅ Form loading and display
- ✅ Form submission and success
- ✅ Form validation errors
- ✅ Navigation to correct profile
- ✅ Role switching and navigation
- ✅ Active role indicator
- ✅ Fallback behavior

---

## Routing Implementation

**Routing Logic:**
```
Movie Lover  → /profile/{username}
Critic       → /critic/{username}
Talent       → /talent-hub/profile/me
Industry Pro → /people (temporary placeholder)
```

**Features:**
- Automatic routing based on active role
- Fallback to lover profile if role undefined
- Easy to update routes in one place
- Helper functions for role metadata

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

1. **Industry Profile Route Enhancement**
   - Replace `/people` placeholder with `/industry/profile/me`
   - Create dedicated industry profile page

2. **Profile Visibility Settings**
   - Add privacy controls for each role profile
   - Allow users to hide/show specific roles

3. **Profile Completion Indicators**
   - Show progress bars for profile completion
   - Suggest missing fields

4. **Profile Preview**
   - Add preview of how profile looks to others
   - Show public vs. private fields

   - Users cannot manually create new role profiles
   - All roles are created with default values
